If there is an error with the page , eg., the server is down, account hacked, go to our support 
page at https://example.com.

After, select or type the error that you have in the search bar, and then you can choose to unban your account, but it will be reviewed by me and our ai will a response such as "User banned becuase he abused chat privilages." something like chat.
It will take a few seconds to decide to unban. But if your account got hacked talk to me at the message admin part of the page. I should respond later usually 2-3 hours sometimes, and I will decide myself.
